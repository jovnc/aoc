# Advent Of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. Each day's solution is organized in its own directory under the year it was created.

## Quick Start

To run the solutions for a specific year and day, use the following command and provide the inputs as interactive prompts.

```bash
make test
```

To clear all solutions, use the following command:

```bash
make clear
```

To create a new solution for a specific year and day, use the following command and provide the inputs as interactive prompts.

```bash
make new
```
